# Architecture

Sujiu follows two hard rules:

1. **Rust owns conversation semantics, model I/O, tool execution and deterministic data transforms.**
2. **Each platform owns presentation and interaction.**

## Layers

### 1. Platform frontends

- `apps/desktop`: Qt/QML
- `apps/android`: Kotlin/Android
- `apps/harmony`: ArkTS/ArkUI

Frontends own navigation, input methods, rendering, animations, window state and platform secure-storage integration. They do not rebuild the AI/tool loop independently.

Each frontend is internally split into four layers — view, presentation, application bridge and platform services — so that page layout and OS capabilities stay independent. The interaction spec, the layer rules, the turn state machine and the `sujiu-ffi` gap analysis live in [UI_ARCHITECTURE.md](UI_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### 2. sujiu-core

Pure Rust domain data with no HTTP or platform SDK dependency.

It owns:

- character data
- world-book data and deterministic keyword matching
- chat/session records
- provider-neutral prompt plans
- prompt compilation
- provider configuration data

It must not own cursor state, UI animation state, widgets, navigation or platform lifecycle.

### 3. sujiu-ai

Rust conversation runtime.

It owns:

- provider-neutral model messages
- tool definitions, calls and results
- the multi-round agent loop
- deferred tool discovery
- provider HTTP adapters
- built-in retrieval tools such as world-book search

The runtime accepts zero, one or multiple tool calls from a model turn, executes client-owned tools in Rust, appends tool results to the transcript and asks the provider to continue until a final assistant response is produced or the configured round limit is reached.

### 4. sujiu-ffi

A deliberately small boundary around Rust. The boundary will expose the conversation runtime to Qt/Kotlin/ArkTS without making any platform reimplement provider or tool semantics.

### 5. Compatibility codecs

SillyTavern/Character Card/World Book support belongs in `sujiu-codec`. External formats are parsed into Sujiu's internal types and exported back out. Unknown external extension fields should be preserved where possible.

The internal model must never become a mirror of SillyTavern's implementation.

## Context and retrieval

Sujiu does **not** treat the model context as a dumping ground.

There are two paths:

```text
deterministic route:
current turn/history
  -> keyword/rule match
  -> small set of world-book entries / tools
  -> prompt/provider

model-driven route:
small initial tool set + sujiu_search_tools
  -> model requests a capability
  -> Rust searches the deferred tool catalog
  -> matching tool schemas become visible next turn
  -> model calls the selected tool
  -> Rust executes it
  -> tool result returns to model
```

This keeps large lore books and large plugin catalogs outside the prompt unless they are relevant.

## Prompt pipeline

```text
App system prompt
  -> character definition
  -> deterministically triggered world-book entries
  -> example dialogue
  -> chat history
  -> post-history instruction
  -> current user input
  -> PromptPlan
  -> sujiu-ai
  -> provider
  -> optional tool-call loop
  -> final assistant response
```

`priority` means client-side retention/ordering priority. It is not presented as a magic model attention weight.

## Tool catalog

A tool contains:

- name
- description
- JSON Schema parameters
- local discovery keywords
- whether it must always be available
- Rust execution logic

The local discovery keywords are **not** sent as model weights. They are only a cheap selector for which schemas deserve context space.

If keyword selection is insufficient, `sujiu_search_tools` lets the model search the deferred catalog without exposing every tool up front.

## Provider boundary

`AiProvider` consumes a provider-neutral request and returns:

- assistant text
- zero or more tool calls
- finish reason / response id metadata

Current concrete transport:

- OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions

Planned adapters reuse the same runtime:

- OpenAI Responses
- Anthropic Messages
- Gemini GenerateContent / function calling

## Dependency direction

```text
platform UI -> FFI -> sujiu-ai -> sujiu-core
                       |
                       +-> provider adapters

compat codec -> sujiu-core
built-in tools -> sujiu-core data
```

The Rust runtime never imports a platform frontend.
